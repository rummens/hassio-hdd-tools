<h1>HDD Tools Hass.io Add-on</h1>
</div>

## General

This add-on provides information about HDD S.M.A.R.T. values using smartmontools.
- By default, the temperature reported by S.M.A.R.T. is visible in Home Assistant via sensor `sensor.hdd_smart`, but you can select to report S.M.A.R.T. status passed value if you prefer.
- All the S.M.A.R.T. attributes are mapped to the sensor as attributes. You can use `template` sensors in Home Assistant to publish them as sensors too.
- Optionally, at start, add-on runs PiBenchmarks https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-storage-benchmarks-2019-benchmarking-script/ and stores output in _/share/hdd_tools/performance.log_

Check the *Documentation* tab to get more information about `options` and `parameters`.

## Notes

For some devices and Home Assistant versions, the addon requires Protection Mode to be disabled to access S.M.A.R.T data. If you see an error in the HDD Tools log try to disable Protection Mode.
